# ShootEmUpGame

### What the Project Does
This is a classic shoot 'em up game made in Java, where the player controls a ship or character that must shoot at enemies while avoiding obstacles and projectiles from a vertical perspective, focusing on fast-paced and intense action. The player faces a variety of enemies that attack in different ways. It is possible to collect power-ups that enhance the player's abilities. The player initially has 3 lives, and each time they are hit by an enemy or its projectile, they lose one and enter a state of invincibility for a short time. After losing all three lives, the player's ship explodes, and the game ends. All elements of the game are represented by geometric shapes

### Why the Project Is Useful
This project serves as a fun and engaging way to learn Java programming and game development concepts, in addition to learning about object-oriented programming. It provides an excellent opportunity for beginners to understand game mechanics, graphics rendering, and user input handling. Additionally, it can be a foundation for more complex game projects.
